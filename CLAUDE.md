# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`mux` is a TUI tmux session manager (Go + Bubble Tea) that shows a live preview of every session, detects AI CLIs (`claude`, `codex`, `aider`, `gemini`), and displays git branch / worktree status and Claude token cost.

This repo is a **personal fork**, third in a chain: `lunemis/mux` → `xguru/mux` → this repo. The module path is `github.com/lloydkwon/mux`. Fork-specific features: the "New shell" / "New tmux session" action rows at the top of the list, persistent per-session ordering (`0`–`9`, `o` to rotate sort), and the Claude progress state badges.

Remotes: `origin` is this fork (`lloydkwon/mux`, SSH), `upstream` is the fork it came from (`xguru/mux`). Push over SSH — the `gh` OAuth token lacks the `workflow` scope, so HTTPS pushes are rejected for touching `.github/workflows/`. Use `go install ./cmd/mux` to install the working tree; `@latest` installs the published branch instead.

## Commands

```bash
make build                       # → ./mux, injects version via -ldflags
make test                        # go test ./...
make install PREFIX=~/.local     # installs to $PREFIX/bin

go test ./ui -run TestFlattenMenu -v    # single test
go vet ./... && golangci-lint run       # expected before submitting (no repo config; defaults)
GOARCH=arm64 go build ./cmd/mux         # CI also cross-compiles this

scripts/test-fixture.sh up      # real tmux sessions (multi-window/pane/empty) for manual TUI checks
scripts/test-fixture.sh down    # tear them down
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs test + build + arm64 cross-build. Releases are tag-driven via goreleaser. Commits follow Conventional Commits.

## Architecture

Three layers, strictly one-directional:

- `cmd/mux` — cobra CLI: root (TUI), `popup`, `setup-keybind`, `status`, `watch`, `panel`, `nav`.
- `tmux/` — everything that shells out or reads the filesystem. No UI dependencies.
- `ui/` — Bubble Tea model, rendering, preferences. Depends on `tmux`.

### All shell exec goes through the injectable runner

`tmux/runner.go` defines a package-level `runner CommandRunner` var. Every `tmux`/`ps`/`pgrep` call in the package must use `runner.Output` / `runner.Run` — that is what makes the package testable. Tests call `SetRunner(mockRunner)` via the `withMock` helper in `tmux/runner_test.go`; the mock is keyed by the exact `"name arg1 arg2"` string, so adding a flag to a command breaks its test until the mock key is updated.

Two deliberate exceptions bypass the runner because they must hit the real process: `getTmuxVersion` in `tmux/popup.go`, and `AttachToSession`/`DetachClient` in `ui/app.go`.

### The 500ms tick drives everything — so everything expensive is TTL-cached

`ui/app.go` ticks every `refreshInterval` (500ms) and on each tick re-issues: `loadSessions`, a preview capture for the cursor row, token usage if the row is an AI session, plus `loadWindows`/`loadPanes` for *every* expanded subtree. Because of that fan-out, all cost sits behind mutex-guarded TTL caches:

| Cache | Location | TTL |
|---|---|---|
| resolved pane command (`pgrep`/`ps` scan) | `tmux/process.go` | 5s |
| git branch / worktree | `tmux/git.go` | 5s |
| Claude token usage (JSONL scan) | `tmux/claude.go` | 10s |

Anything new that runs per-tick needs the same treatment.

Every tick is *stateless*: `sessionsLoadedMsg` replaces `m.sessions` wholesale and the previous slice is dropped, and nothing in the TUI compares one tick against the last. The only cross-tick history in the codebase lives in `mux watch`, not here — see below.

### Flattened tree list model

There is no nested view. `ui/tree.go`'s `flattenMenu` produces a flat `[]listItem` — action rows, then each session, then (if expanded) its windows, then (if expanded) their panes — and `Model.cursor` is an index into that slice. `treeState` holds the expansion sets plus the window/pane caches; expansion survives session refreshes, and `pruneCaches` drops entries for sessions that vanished.

Call `rebuildItems()` after any change to sessions, filter text, ordering, or expansion state, or the cursor will point at a stale row. Action rows are only included in the unfiltered top-level view.

### Preview targeting

`previewKey{session, window, pane}` uses `-1` as "the active one"; `.target()` renders it as tmux target syntax (`sess`, `sess:1`, `sess:1.2`). The model caches one preview blob plus the key it belongs to, and `viewMain` only renders it when that key still equals `previewKeyForItem(currentItem)` — otherwise the pane shows blank rather than the wrong session's output.

### Attaching happens after the TUI exits

Never attach from inside the Bubble Tea loop. `Update` records `attachTarget` / `detachRequested` and returns `tea.Quit`; `cmd/mux/main.go` inspects the returned model and then calls `ui.AttachToSession`, which `select-window`/`select-pane` first (attach replaces the process) and then either `switch-client` (inside tmux, `$TMUX` set) or `syscall.Exec` of `attach-session` (outside). "New shell" only detaches when `$TMUX` is set; outside tmux, quitting already returns to the login shell.

### Modal sub-models

`mode` selects which `updateX` handles input. Sub-models (`create`, `rename`, `filter`, `confirmKill`, `order`) are plain structs with their own `Update`/`View`; they report completion by emitting a message (`sessionCreatedMsg`, `sessionRenamedMsg`, `sessionOrderMsg`, …) that the *top-level* `Update` handles before mode dispatch — that is where mode is reset to `modeList` and side effects like preference writes happen.

### The sidebar lives in `mux watch`

The panel is a pane on the **left** of the window (`split-window -hb`, `tmux/panel.go`), 48 columns wide unless the session remembers a dragged width in `@mux_panel_width`. `notifyLines` (`ui/notify.go`) renders the whole thing borderless — the tmux pane already draws one — and `watchModel.View` drops it into `fixedBox`.

**The panel draws no session's screen, deliberately.** A detail column that previewed the selected session was built and removed: it took half the panel to show a copy of a pane, and the copy you most wanted was usually the real pane sitting right beside it. What the panel shows is what a terminal cannot — which sessions exist, what state each is in, and what they *just* finished. The rest of the window stays your shell.

Because there is nothing to read first, **a click switches**. The keyboard keeps two steps only because `send-keys` cannot point and commit at once: `mux nav up/down` moves `m.selected` and `enter` commits it. That cursor is a session *name*, not a row index — rows are ordered by how long a state has held (`sortByDisplayedAge`), so an index means something different two seconds later. `reselect` re-anchors it every refresh.

**`ownSession`** is resolved once in `RunWatch` (`tmux.SessionForPane(selfPane())`). It marks that row `◀` and makes `autoSelect` skip it: the session you are working in is nearly always the top row, since rows sort by how recently a state changed and that is the session whose state keeps changing — so the cursor would otherwise start on the one row where `enter` goes nowhere. Skipping applies to *auto*-selection only, so choosing it stands. An empty `ownSession` means "could not tell" and restores the behavior from before it existed rather than guessing either way.

Blank lines in the session column are layout, not decoration: a session's trailing blank carries that session's name, which is what makes a click target two rows tall. Group and section breaks carry none, so they do not stretch the block above them.

**`restoreFocus` is guarded by `PaneActive`, and the guard is load-bearing.** tmux's `MouseDown1Pane` runs `select-pane` before forwarding a click, so after a click the panel *is* active and `select-pane -l` is exactly the undo — without it, the window keeps reporting the panel's directory as its session's own (`tmux/panel.go`'s `-c` comment). Keys arrive by `send-keys` and never make it active, and restoring there selects whatever the window visited before the pane the user is in. Measured: `enter` from a three-pane window moved focus to the third pane.

**Keys reach the panel without focus reaching it.** `mux nav <up|down|top|bottom|enter>` resolves the window's panel pane and `send-keys` to it. The directions are a vocabulary, not raw key names, so `handleKey` can change without every user's tmux.conf changing. A window with no panel exits 0 — the binding is global and a failing `run-shell` writes to the status line on every press.

The panel speaks Korean and the TUI speaks English. `aiStateLabel` (`ui/notify.go`) is the panel's side of that and `AIState.String()` is the TUI's. Do not mix them in one pane.

`mux watch` is a pane and not a popup for a reason worth not re-litigating: tmux has no floating window that leaves the keyboard alone. `display-popup` is documented as "Panes are not updated while a popup is present" — it freezes what is behind it and takes input. A pane is the only always-visible tmux surface that still lets you type, which is also why the companion `my-mux` widget is a GTK3 dock window on the desktop rather than anything inside a terminal.

It runs as a **separate process**, so it shares no state with the TUI: its own `prevAIStates` — the codebase's only cross-tick history, since a transition can only be seen by diffing — its own event log, its own TTL caches, and a slower 2s tick (the 500ms rate exists for the TUI cursor row's preview, which reacts to a keystroke; this one reacts to a click).

Every tmux call it makes must name its own pane (`selfPane()`, from `$TMUX_PANE`). tmux resolves an omitted target to the window's *active* pane, which is the one the user works in — the panel is created detached and never becomes active on its own. A width correction sent without a target shrank the wrong pane, and the panel grew to fill what it gave up.

Pane width is held against tmux, not just recorded. With `aggressive-resize`, switching sessions resizes windows and tmux redistributes panes, so the panel drifted every switch. `applyResize` separates the two causes by reading the *window* width: unchanged window plus changed pane is a border drag (adopt it), changed window is a re-layout (undo it). Two rules keep it from running away — the window width is read **synchronously**, because getting it via a `tea.Cmd` let a stale value read as "window unchanged" and a momentarily squeezed pane became the enforced width; and a width below `notifyMinWidth` is never adopted as intent.

`modeHelp` is the deliberate exception: it carries no state, so it has no sub-model struct, no `Model` field, and no completion message — just an enum value, a `case` in the mode dispatch that resets to `modeList` on any `tea.KeyMsg`, and `viewHelp` in `View`. Don't add a `helpModel` to make it match the others. It also renders through `fixedBox` instead of `viewWithOverlay`, because a centered box has no size bound and the page is taller than a `mux popup` gets on an 80x24 terminal (68x19) — that budget is pinned by `TestHelpBodyFitsPopup`, and adding a line to `renderHelpBody` will fail it.

### Manual fixed-size rendering

`ui/layout.go` (`padOrTruncate`, `fixedBox`, `drawBorder`, `joinHorizontalFixed`) does the layout by hand instead of using lipgloss containers, because `capture-pane -e` output carries raw ANSI that must be clipped to an exact cell width. Two consequences:

- Every rendered panel must return exactly `panelHeight` lines and exact widths, or the two columns desynchronize.
- **Width compensation is impossible here.** `drawBorder` re-pads every line to `innerWidth`, so any cell a row subtracts to account for a wide glyph is added straight back. The only workable rule is to emit glyphs whose drawn width equals `ansi.StringWidth` — verify a new glyph before using it (`TestGlyphWidthsAreStable` in `ui/list_test.go` pins the current set). Emoji measure and draw 2; most geometric shapes measure and draw 1.
- **Never wrap a row containing nested styled spans in an outer style.** A nested `lipgloss.Render` emits its own `ESC[0m`, which resets the *background* too, so a colored segment mid-row strips the selection highlight from everything after it. `renderRow` (`ui/layout.go`) builds rows from `rowSeg` values where each span re-states the full style, background included.

### One AI badge, two facts

AI CLI detection is a single feature, not a generic layer with a Claude feature bolted beside it. `tmux/aitools.go` owns all of it: `aiToolMap` (which tools exist, their icon and color) *and* `AIState` (`None`/`Working`/`Approval`/`Ready`) with `AIState.Icon()` (`⏳`/`❗`/`✅`).

**The rule: a live state glyph replaces the tool icon, it never sits beside it.** `ui/status.go`'s `aiGlyph` is the one place that decides, and `ui/list.go`, `ui/preview.go`, and `mux status` all go through it. A separate state column would repeat what the tool icon already says, since only a detected AI CLI can have a state. Keep it that way when adding anything state-related.

The badge cell is padded to `badgeWidth` (2) even when empty, because state glyphs measure 2 and tool icons measure 1 — that padding is what keeps the git branch in one column across every row. `sessionNameMin` is tuned so prefix + name + badge exactly fills an 80-col panel: the badge is the last thing cut, not the first.

The list's elapsed column shows the *state's* age for a session with live state (`sessionAge`) and the session's creation age otherwise, and takes the state color — with the glyph folded into the badge, that color is what still marks a blocked row at a glance.

### Claude live-state chain

Claude is the only tool that publishes live state, so `tmux/claude_status.go` is the sole producer of a non-zero `AIState`. It reads `~/.claude/sessions/*.json` — Claude Code's own state file, one per running session — and indexes them by tmux session name via each file's `tmux` field (`"<session>:@<win>.%<pane>"`). `ClaudeStatuses()` does one `os.ReadDir` per refresh behind a 1s TTL cache, and `ListSessions` hoists that single call out of its parse loop, so state arrives atomically with the session slice and needs no tick fan-out or `Model` cache.

Four things about this data are easy to get wrong:

- **The file is written only on status change, so mtime is not a heartbeat.** A crashed session leaves its file behind and would display as permanently busy. Liveness is `processAlive` (`tmux/proc.go`): signal-0 for existence, plus a best-effort `/proc/<pid>/stat` field-22 comparison against the file's `procStart` to catch PID reuse. The `/proc` half no-ops on macOS by design — no build tags.
- **`status: "waiting"` means blocked on the user**, whatever `waitingFor` says; a finished turn sitting at the prompt reports `idle` instead. That mapping lives in `mapClaudeState`.
- **`status: "shell"` outranks both `idle` and `busy`, and it is sticky.** Claude reports it for as long as *any* background shell is alive, so a session that left a dev server running never reaches `idle` — its turns end invisibly and anything watching for a turn to finish waits forever. Measured: a session actively generating output reported `shell` for 13 minutes because one server was up. `demoteServerShell` (`tmux/claude_status.go`) recovers the common case by reading the Claude-owned children under `/proc/<pid>/task/<pid>/children` (identified by `shell-snapshots/` in their cmdline, which excludes MCP servers) and promoting to `AIStateReady` when *every* one of them matches `serverCmdPattern`. Anything else — a build, a test run, a download — is real work and the shell state stands, as does "no jobs found", since no `/proc` must not read as "the turn ended". Ported from my-mux's `demoteServerShells`; keep the two pattern lists in step.
- The format is private and unversioned. Every field decodes as optional; a renamed field must degrade to "no badge", never an error.

Because `Session.ActiveCommand` only reflects the *active pane of the active window*, this state file also covers Claude running in a background window. `tmux.SessionAITool` prefers it over `ActiveCommand` so the badge, token loading, and `mux status` all catch that case — and it hardcodes `"claude"` for the stateful path, since a second state provider would first have to carry its own tool name onto `Session`.

### Claude cost tracking chain

`tmux/claude.go`: pane PID → `pgrep -P` children → `~/.claude/sessions/<childPID>.json` → `{sessionId, cwd}` → `~/.claude/projects/<cwd with "/" replaced by "-">/<sessionId>.jsonl` → sum `usage` fields on `type: "assistant"` lines. Per-1M pricing constants are hardcoded in `estimateCost` (currently Opus-tier rates) and are an estimate only. `ui/app.go` gates the per-tick load on `tool.Name == "claude"` — any other AI CLI would scan for a file that is not there.

### Preferences

`ui/preferences.go` stores sort mode and the `{session name: order}` map in `os.UserConfigDir()/mux/preferences.json`, written atomically (temp file + `chmod 0600` + rename). `normalized()` is the validation gate — it runs on both load and save and drops blank names / non-positive orders. Rename and kill both fix up the `Orders` map so entries don't leak.

### tmux config editing

`SetupKeybind` (`tmux/popup.go`) writes an idempotent, marker-tagged (`# mux popup keybinding`) bind line. It detects gpakosz/.tmux ("oh-my-tmux") by symlink target or the `# : << 'EOF'` first-line signature, and for those installs writes to `.tmux.conf.local` *before* the `# "$@"` sentinel — writing into the main `.tmux.conf` corrupts oh-my-tmux's heredoc. It also strips legacy untagged installer binds. Preserve all of that when touching this file.
